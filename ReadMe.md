## Canada Community Bio

This basic website has been cloned from [here](https://kbroman.org/simple_site).

The intention of this site is to provide a static landing page that people looking for information on Canadian Community Bio labs can be pointed. Rather than being continually updated, it is intended just as a pointer to the mailing list and other long-lived resources.
